	abstract = {Like many taxa, the Zetaproteobacteria lack well-defined taxonomic divisions, making it difficult to compare them between studies. We designed ZetaHunter to reproducibly assign 16S rRNA gene sequences to previously described operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a curated database. While ZetaHunter can use any given database, we included a curated classification of publicly available Zetaproteobacteria.},
